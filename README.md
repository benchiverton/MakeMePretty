### Winner of the Creative Concept Award

#### Conecpt:
Create an application that re-constructs your face from other peoples faces, replacing each section of the face with a 'best match'.

#### Usage:
1. Take a picture of your face. It is preferable to, if you're doing this to your own face, that you:
 - take a picture with a white background
 - try to center your face as much as you can!
 
1. Ensure that this image is 500x500 pixels (exactly), a '.png' file, and saved as photo.png inside the src folder.

1. Run 'Profile/src/MakePretty.java' - it should save the result as 'Profile/saved.png'.
