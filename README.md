# MakeMePretty

## Winner of the Creative Concept Awart

Program made for 2017 Hackathon!

It is preferable to, if you're doing this to your own face, that you:
 - take a picture with a white background
 - try to center your face as much as you can!
 
Make sure this image is 500x500 pixels (exactly), a '.png' file, and saved as photo.png inside the src folder.

Run 'Profile/src/MakePretty.java' - it should save the result as 'Profile/saved.png'.

This is my first project on GitHub - sorry if it is formatted poorly!

NOTE: The images which 'replace' parts of your face were from a quick google search, and are not my own - if this is not okay for any reason, feel free to email me telling me to remove any of these images and I will do promptly.
