# MakeMePretty
Program made for 2017 Hackathon!

It is preferable to, if you're doing this to your own face, that you:
 - take a picture with a white background
 - center your face as much as possible!
 
Make sure this image is 500x500 pixels, a .png file, and saved as photo.png inside the src folder.

Once the program has run, it should save it as saved.png inside the Profile folder!

This is my first project on GitHub - sorry if it is formatted poorly!

NOTE: The images which 'replace' parts of your face were from a quick google search, and are not my own - if this is not okay for any reason, feel free to email me telling me to remove any of these images and I will do promptly!
