# MakeMePretty
Program made for 2017 Hackathon!

It is preferable to, if you're doing this to your own face, you:
 - take a picture with a white background
 - center your face as much as possible!
 
Make sure this image is 500x500, a .png file, and saved as photo.png inside the src folder.

Once the program has run, it should save it as saved.png inside the Profile folder!

This is my first project on GitHub - sorry if it is formatted poorly!
